title: Exploring Stellar Evolution in the Eagle Nebula Using Gaia DR3 Data
---

The data used in this project mainly include astronomical observation data from the Gaia DR3 star catalog, especially for the iconic Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula and the stars around them. This dataset includes key astronomical measurements, such as star positions, parallaxes, and photometric magnitudes. These data points are numerical, continuous and multi-dimensional, providing rich information for understanding stars' spatial and motion characteristics in the nebula.
