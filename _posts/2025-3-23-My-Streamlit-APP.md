ðŸš€ **Explore the stars of the Pillars of Creation using real data from the Gaia DR3 catalog!**

This interactive web app was built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **Plotly/Seaborn** to visualize stellar data from the iconic _Eagle Nebula_ region. The app includes:

- An interactive **Sky Map** of star positions  
- A **Color-Magnitude Diagram** (HR Diagram)  
- A live view of the **raw dataset**
