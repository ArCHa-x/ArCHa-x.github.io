title: Exploring Stellar Evolution in the Eagle Nebula Using Gaia DR3 Data
---

The data used in this project mainly include astronomical observation data from the Gaia DR3 star catalog, especially for the iconic Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula and the stars around them. This dataset includes key astronomical measurements, such as star positions, parallaxes, and photometric magnitudes. These data points are numerical, continuous and multi-dimensional, providing rich information for understanding stars' spatial and motion characteristics in the nebula.

I chose this dataset because I am fascinated by the star formation process and nebula evolution, especially in a visually stunning and scientifically rich environment like the Eagle Nebula. The Gaia DR3 data has extremely high precision and coverage, allowing for a detailed exploration of how stellar populations form, evolve, and influence their surroundings. A notable article that I highly recommend in my literature review is "Chronology of star formation and disk evolution in the Eagle Nebula" by Guarcello et al. (2010). This study provides an in-depth analysis of the continuous formation mode of stars and stellar feedback mechanisms, which greatly enhances our understanding of nebular dynamics and the evolution of structures such as the Pillars of Creation.
