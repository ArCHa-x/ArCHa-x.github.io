title: Exploring Stellar Evolution in the Eagle Nebula Using Gaia DR3 Data
---

The data used in this project mainly include astronomical observation data from the Gaia DR3 star catalog, especially for the iconic Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula and the stars around them. This dataset includes key astronomical measurements, such as star positions, parallaxes, and photometric magnitudes. These data points are numerical, continuous and multi-dimensional, providing rich information for understanding stars' spatial and motion characteristics in the nebula.

I chose this dataset because I am interested in the formation process and nebular evolution, especially the amazing landscape of the Pillars of Creation. A famous article that I recommend in my literature review is [_Chronology of star formation and disk evolution in the Eagle Nebula_](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2010/13/aa14351-10/aa14351-10.html).  by Guarcello et al. (2010). This study provides an in-depth analysis of the continuous formation mode of stars and the stellar feedback mechanism, which greatly enhances my understanding of nebular dynamics and the evolution of structures of the Pillars of Creation.
